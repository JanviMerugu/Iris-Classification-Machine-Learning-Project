# Iris Classification Machine Learning Project 🌸

This project classifies the Iris dataset into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using machine learning models: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees.

## Project Overview 📊

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers with four features:
- Sepal Length 🌱
- Sepal Width 🌱
- Petal Length 🌺
- Petal Width 🌺

The objective is to train a machine learning model to predict the species of an iris flower based on these features.

## Features 🛠️

- **Classification Models**:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 🔍
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM) 💻
  - Decision Trees 🌳
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and cross-validation metrics are used to assess model performance. 📈
- **Preprocessing**: The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and features are scaled for better model performance. ⚙️
- **Model Comparison**: Models are compared to identify the most accurate one. 🏆
- **Visualization**: The dataset and model performance are visualized using Matplotlib. 📉

## What’s Done ✅
